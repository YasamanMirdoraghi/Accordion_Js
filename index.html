                                In the simplest answer to what JavaScript is, it can be said that JavaScript is a high-level language for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. The main mission of this language is to improve interaction and "User Experience" (User Experience) of visitors and web users by creating elements such as "Navigation Drawers", graphic elements, dynamic background colors, etc.  This popular language is now used in many areas of technology and the Internet, including web development and programming, game development, web application development, server side programming, etc. As mentioned, JavaScript makes the interaction between the user and web pages in the best possible way, which is not done by elements like HTML and CSS alone. Today, many advanced and even old browsers use JavaScript as their main programming language, and by using it, they provide a unique user experience to web users.

                                It is the same as the C programming language that has been expanded with object-oriented features. The presence of two plus signs after the letter C in the name of this language indicates the addition of the addition function in it. The C++ programming language was created to transfer the features of older programming languages ​​to newer, faster and more powerful platforms. The job market of C++ programming language is considered almost the same as that of C programming language, including systems programming, low-level hardware development, web services, and general and proprietary applications.                            </p>

                                Java is a leading and general-purpose programming language and framework. This programming language was presented in 1991 by "Sun Microsystems" as a high-level programming language, compiled and managed with memory. The writing structure (Syntax) of Java programming is similar to C and C++ programming, one of the differences of this language is having braces for closing and semicolons for final commands.Automatic memory management is one of the features that made Java programming so popular quickly after its initial release. Before the Java programming language was introduced, most types of programming languages ​​that required manual memory management, such as C and C++ programming languages, were used.

                                Before Java language was introduced, C programming language was considered as the highest level programming language. This programming language was introduced for the first time in 1972. At that time, the first versions of the Unix operating system (Unix) written in assembly programming language (Assembly) were transferred to C language, and then in the development of other early operating systems, including the "IBM System/370" programming language C was used.
